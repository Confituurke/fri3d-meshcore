# Third-party notices

This app adapts and interoperates with the following third-party works. The three code and
reference works are each used under the MIT License; their original copyright notices are
reproduced below, followed by the MIT license text (identical for all three). The bundled
font is used under the SIL Open Font License 1.1.

## python-pure25519
Copyright (c) 2015 Brian Warner and contributors
https://github.com/warner/python-pure25519

Ed25519 field/point arithmetic and EdDSA sign/verify are vendored and adapted (made
pure-Python and MicroPython-compatible) in `eu.axistem.micropymesh/meshcore_crypto.py`.

## meshcore-pi
Copyright (c) 2025 Brian Widdas
https://github.com/brianwiddas/meshcore-pi

The X25519 shared-secret derivation and MeshCore's identity-key convention (a node's private
key is the 64-byte SHA512(seed)) were ported into `meshcore_crypto.py`. meshcore-pi was also
used as an independent cross-implementation reference to validate the packet, channel, advert
and direct-message codecs.

## MeshCore
Copyright (c) 2025 Scott Powell / rippleradios.com
https://github.com/ripplebiz/MeshCore

Used as the protocol / wire-format reference (packet header, group-channel and direct-message
crypto, advert layout, and the PATH/ACK acknowledgement format). No source code is copied; the
interoperable wire format is re-implemented in pure Python from the specification and source.

**The app icon** (`eu.axistem.micropymesh/icon_64x64.png`) is derived from the official MeshCore
wordmark, which ships in that MIT-licensed repository at `logo/meshcore.svg` and which the
MeshCore FAQ (7.4) makes available for use. The letterforms are the original ones, sliced
between the "H" and the "C" and stacked to fit a square icon; nothing was redrawn or
re-typeset. MESHCORE is a trademark of its owner: this app is an independent, community-built
client and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the MeshCore project.

## Archivo Narrow
Copyright 2019 The Archivo Narrow Project Authors
https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/ArchivoNarrow

Licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 -- **not** the MIT License that covers
the rest of this app. The full text ships with the fonts at
`eu.axistem.micropymesh/fonts/OFL.txt`, as the OFL requires.

`ArchivoNarrow-Regular.ttf` and `ArchivoNarrow-SemiBold.ttf` are instances (weights 400 and
600) of the upstream variable font, subset to Latin-1 plus a few symbols by
`tools/make_fonts.py`. The font carries no Reserved Font Name, so the modified copies keep the
family name. They are bundled and rendered, never sold on their own.

## Mesh Mono (a subset of IBM Plex Mono)
Copyright 2017 IBM Corp., with Reserved Font Name "Plex"
https://github.com/IBM/plex

Licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1; the full text ships at
`eu.axistem.micropymesh/fonts/OFL-IBMPlexMono.txt`.

`MeshMono-Regular.ttf` is IBM Plex Mono Regular subset to Latin-1 plus a few symbols by
`tools/make_fonts.py`. Because "Plex" is a Reserved Font Name, the modified font is renamed
"Mesh Mono"; its copyright and trademark records are unchanged. IBM Plex is a trademark of
IBM Corp.
