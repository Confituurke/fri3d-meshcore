# MeshCoreManager -- background MeshCore node/radio owner (singleton).
#
# Owns the shared SX1262 and runs passively in the background, independent of any UI, so
# the device listens (and can send on public channels) even when no MeshCore screen is
# open.  Enabled by an app-local toggle (`service_enabled` pref): MeshCoreBootService starts
# it at boot when enabled, and the Settings switch turns it on/off live.  UI activities
# attach as a data source.
#
# Data model (all lvgl-free; UI subscribes via add_subscriber and marshals to LVGL):
#   - nodes     : companions, repeaters and rooms learned from ADVERT packets (signature
#                 checked when the native meshcrypto module is present)
#   - channels  : public group channels (default "Public" + user-added), Channel objects
#   - messages  : per-channel chat history (public group text, decoded)
#   - packets   : raw parsed-packet log (debug)
#
# Radio settings verified against MeshCore source. cr=5 (4/5) matches standard MeshCore
# nodes -- required for interop (both RX decode and TX being decodable by companion/repeater).
